// # Intuition
// <!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->



// This approach involves using the linked list cycle detection method (Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm). For an array of length 
// ùëÅ+1 with integers in the range [1,N], we can use the two-pointer technique to detect a cycle.

// Approach
// We use the fast pointer and slow pointer method. The difference is that we traverse to the location pointed by the array's value as the next one:

// slow = nums[slow]
// fast = nums[nums[fast]]
// Once they meet, we are sure there is a cycle in the array. For example, for the array [1,2,3,4,2], the slow pointer goes from the 0th place to the 1st (value 2), and the fast pointer goes from the 0th place to the 2nd place (value 3). Eventually, slow = 2 and fast = 2. Then, we just need to find the start of the cycle, which is the duplicate element.
